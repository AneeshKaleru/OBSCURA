# OBSCURA: Optical Boost for Scene Clarity Under Reduced Atmosphere

This project integrates computer vision and deep learning techniques to mitigate visibility degradation in foggy conditions. Utilizing a two-stage pipeline, it first applies advanced image defogging algorithms to restore scene clarity while detecting critical road elements such as objects and lane boundaries. The framework is then extended to sequential video data through frame-wise processing, ensuring temporal coherence and real-time adaptability. By enhancing perceptual robustness in adverse weather, this system contributes to safer human and autonomous navigation.
